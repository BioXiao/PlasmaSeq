Title: Detection of CNV in exome/targeted sequencing data
Version: 1.0.3

Author: Michael Love
Maintainer: Michael Love <love@molgen.mpg.de>
Description: A hidden Markov model for the detection of copy number variants (CNV) in exome/targeted sequencing read depth data.  The package uses positional covariates, such as background read depth and GC-content, to simultaneously normalize and segment the samples into regions of constant copy count.
