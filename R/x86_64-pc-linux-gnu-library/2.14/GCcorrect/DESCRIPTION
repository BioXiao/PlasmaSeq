Description: GCcorrect implements methods to estimate and correct for the GC bias on a single DNA-seq sample. 
 It estimates the bias in coverage induced by the number G+C bases of a fragment.
 The bias is measured on a subset of genomic locations, using only mappable and otherwise 
 agreeably locations. Single-base predictions of coverage are generated; corrected counts
 based on these predictions provide copy number estimation. For more information 
 see Benjamini and Speed (2012).
